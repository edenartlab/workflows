description: Use a style image to apply style-transfer to a video
tip: This will create a new video with similar shapes / motions as the input video but a different texture. It can be used to create stylistic re-interpretations of input videos.

  label: Target resolution for processing the video
  description: Higher resolutions usually lead to better quality output videos. 896 is a good default, 640 can be used to do a quick test, 1024 is for HD video and 1280 for exceptionally high quality but super slow video style transfers!
  tip: You can sometimes increase the resolution to achieve a higher quality style transfer effect, however this comes at a huge speed and cost tradeoff, HD is VERY slow, so only use this when specifically requested!

  description: Maximum input video frames to process (the input video is sampled at 8 fps, so frame_cap / 8 will be the output video duration). 0 uses all input video frames (can lead to OOM crashes when there are too many, so usually its safer to specify this at a large enough value, eg 128)

  description: Whether or not to create a seamlessly looping animation where end frame is identical to starting frame.
