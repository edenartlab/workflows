description: Remove the background from a video.
tip: |-
  Background removal can do a great job of isolating a foreground subject, returns a .png sequence video with an alpha channel where the background is removed. This tool is a good choice for isolating a subject from an movie, and is often used in conjunction with other tools to generate images with a clean background. Keep in mind that a non-technical user may not have the vocabulary to describe what they want, and interpret their request with your best judgement as to whether or not the background removal is what they are requesting, considering terms like alpha, transparency, or other requests for an video with no background as a suggestion to consider this tool when provided with such a request and a movie to operate on.
