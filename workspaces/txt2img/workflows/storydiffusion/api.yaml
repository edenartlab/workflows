description: A multi-prompt to multi-image workflow that uses storydiffusion to generate consistent characters across images without LoRa.
tip: This is an advanced tool and should only be used when specifically requested. If the user underspecifies how the characters should look, fill in some details for them, but stay true to their vision of the character.

  description: Format is an array of strings, each of which is formatted like "[Name] visual description", with name always in the beginning and in brackets.
  tip: Use a concise and purely visual description of the character. For example, ["[Alice] a woman wearing a green jacket, short black hair, thick-rimmed glasses, and a red backpack.", "[Bob] a man with a beard with a gray stripe, a monocle, and a bionic arm."]

  label: Scene Descriptions
  description: Format is an array of strings, each of which is formatted as "[Name] scene description", where [Name] is one of the charactgers defined in the character_prompts.
  tip: Each scene can have just one character. Put into brackets *only the reference to the chosen character by name, e.g. "[Bob] is sitting on a bench eating a sandwich." Do not bracket any other characters or words. Just one bracketed name from the character_prompts, in the beginning and nothing else. A good example is, ["[Alice] is riding a bike down a hill with the city in the background.", "[Bob] is sitting on a bench eating a sandwich."]. DO NOT put brackets around anything that isn't a character name defined in character_prompts! Do not use brackets like [Time Travel] or [Meeting]. You would just use brackets around one of [Alice] or [Bob] in the beginning of the example.
