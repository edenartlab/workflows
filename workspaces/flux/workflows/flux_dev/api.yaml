description: Generate an image from text using Flux.
tip: |-
  Flux is a text to image model by Black Forest Labs (ex StabilityAI employees ) that excels at prompt coherence, aesthetics and text generation. This tool is a strong choice for generating an image from text! Flux-dev can use ControlNet guidance to maintain the contours or shape outlines of the input image while generating a new style or aesthetic on top of it, and LoRA models to apply a pretrained fine tuned concept. While controlnet exists for this tool, the controlnet models released so far are considered inferior to those from SDXL, and the other tools should be preferred for shape guidance creations. Flux-dev was trained on a dataset ranging in size from .1 to 2 megapixels, and is capable of generating images at higher resolutions than Stable Diffusion without noticable artifacting. While best practice seems to dictate that Flux likes similar resolutions to Stable Diffusion (such as those in the resolutions: list), it is capable of good results higher resolutions, rounded to 64 pixels such as 1920x1088, 1408x1408, 1728x1152, 1664x1216 etc.

    tip: |-
      Flux loves very detailed and descriptive prompts so try to be elaborate. Flux is also great at drawing text in images when requested. Flux uses a T5 text encoder in addition to CLIP, which allows for more conversational human-like natural language prompting. Create great T5 text encoder prompts for Flux-dev by specifying the subject, style, composition, lighting, color palette, mood/atmosphere, technical details, and additional elements to guide the generation of detailed and cohesive visual descriptions.

    description: Strength of the AI generation process on top of the starting image
    tip: |-
      Decreasing generation strength increases the influence of a starting image in image-to-image workflows. The default of 1 is 100% AI creativity, ignoring all traces of the starting image, whereas a medium blend of about 50% will maintain close adherance to the original input. You typically want to use this with high denoise values >0.8 for Flux unless you only want only very subtle variations of the starting image.

      Override the width and height parameters with the resolution of your starting image.
    tip: |-
      It's best practice to use resolutions included in the models training data. Upscaling later can get you to a higher resolution, but if you need to match the exact image dimensions of your input, this should be true. Keep in mind that all diffusion models will enforce an 8 pixel alignment, so if your input image has a dimension that is not divisible by 8, it will be rounded to the nearest 8 pixel value.

    tip: |-
      Help the user determine the best preprocessor for their input image. CannyEdgePreprocessor detects thin binary edges and is useful for tasks requiring fast edge detection, such as architectural designs or simple object outlines, but it may struggle with complex scenes or noise. MiDaS-DepthMapPreprocessor generates luminance-based depth maps and is ideal for creating realistic 3D-like compositions, such as emphasizing depth in landscapes or isolating foreground objects. HEDPreprocessor excels at producing smooth, intricate edge detection and is suitable for detailed illustrations, artistic line work, or noise-sensitive scenes. DWPreprocessor, as an OpenPose-based preprocessor, identifies human keypoints and is perfect for generating images with accurate human poses, such as action shots, dance scenes, or character positioning. AnyLineArtPreprocessor_aux converts images into detailed line drawings and is best for black-and-white artwork, manga-style illustrations, or clear contrast outlines. ScribblePreprocessor processes rough sketches into structured inputs, ideal for refining rough concepts or integrating hand-drawn elements into finished compositions with a sketch-like aesthetic.

      Style images can be used to guide the color palette, texture, and overall style of the generated image. This can be useful for creating images with a specific look or feel, such as a painting or photograph. This implementation uses the Flux Redux model to transfer traits of the style image to the output creation.

      A good default for Flux Redux is around 0.75, with ranges between 0.5 for subtle guidance, and 0.9 for more heavy handed results. This parameter is very sensative, and small changes can have a large impact on the output. The prompt length, source image, and other factors like custom model lora strength can all affect the optimal value for this parameter.
