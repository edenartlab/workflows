name: Stylize a video
description: Apply a new style to an existing video.

tip: This will create a new video with similar shapes / motions as the input video but a different texture corresponding to the style image input. It can be used to create stylistic re-interpretations of input videos.

- name: resolution
  label: Target resolution for processing the video
  description: Higher resolutions usually lead to better quality output videos. 896 is a good default, 640 can be used to do a quick test, 1024 is for HD video and 1280 for exceptionally high quality but super slow video style transfers!
  tip: You can sometimes increase the resolution to achieve a higher quality style transfer effect, however this comes at a huge speed and cost tradeoff, HD is VERY slow, so only use this when specifically requested!

- name: frame_cap
  label: Maximum video frames to process
  description: Maximum input video frames to process (the input video is sampled at 8 fps, so frame_cap / 8 will be the output video duration). 0 uses all input video frames (can lead to OOM crashes when there are too many, so usually its safer to specify this at a large enough value, eg 128)

  label: Shape guidance strength
  description: Strength of the input videos shape guidance (recommended between 0.4-0.6)
  tip: Setting low values (0.3-0.45) will result in more creative freedom by the model and better adherence to the style image. High values (0.45-0.65) will increase adherence to the source video at the cost of output aesthetics.

  label: Closed Loop Animation
  description: Whether or not to create a seamlessly looping animation where end frame is identical to starting frame. 
  tip: For normal video input this should usually be false, for inputs that are looping gifs or animations, set this to true. Ask the user to specify this if unsure.
