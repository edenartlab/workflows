name: Stylize a video
description: Apply a new style to an existing video.
thumbnail: app/vid2vid_sdxl_opt.mp4
tip: This will create a new video with similar shapes / motions as the input video but a different texture corresponding to the style image input. It can be used to create stylistic re-interpretations of input videos.

  label: Processing resolution
  description: Higher resolutions usually leads to better quality output videos. 896 is a good default, 640 can be used to do a quick test, >1024 is for best quality but very slow
  tip: You can sometimes increase the resolution to achieve a higher quality style transfer effect, however this comes at a big speed and cost tradeoff, HD is VERY slow, so only use this when specifically requested!

  label: Shape guidance strength
  description: Strength of the input videos shape guidance (recommended between 0.45-0.55)
  tip: Setting low values (0.3-0.45) will result in more creative freedom by the model and better adherence to the style image. High values (0.55-0.65) will increase adherence to the source video at the cost of output aesthetics.

- name: diffusion_framerate
  label: Diffusion Framerate
  description: The framerate at which frames are extracted from the source video and processed by the model. 
  tip: Typically you set this to the default of 8 because then you get more seconds of processed video per diffused frame. If the input video contains fast motion however, you can set this to 12 to maintain more of that motion intact and get less visual artefacts from the RIFE interpolation that brings the output video back to 24 fps.

  description: Whether or not to create a seamlessly looping animation where end frame is identical to starting frame. 
  tip: For normal video input this should usually be false, for inputs that are looping gifs or animations, set this to true. Ask the user to specify this if unsure.

  tip: You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this at default!
