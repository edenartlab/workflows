name: Animate an image with depth
description: Precise image animation using 3D-zoom.
tip: |-
  Creative image animation using AnimateDiff. This should only be used for creating subtly animated versions of artworks with very minimal motion and is not suited for creating stories or prompt driven motion (use RunWay for that).
  With default settings this tool will apply subtle 3D-motion effect to an input image, add some motion to the background and optionally apply a style effect. By default, this tool creates a looping 3D zoom effect, but the looping can be turned off to create a zooming in effect instead.
  If the image has a sensitive or very specific foreground subject (like a human face or character), a lower foreground_denoise strength can be used to avoid corrupting the subject details. This tool is pretty slow and typically used to create minimally animated versions of beautiful still art.

    tip: |-
      Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the background of the input image. This can typically be somewhat higher than the foreground motion strength unless the user requests otherwise or wants the background to remain fairly consistent.

    tip: |-
      Higher values cause more animation, but can also stray further away from the foreground of the input image. Typically, you want to keep this value in the low range (0.25 - 0.4) to avoid drifting too far away from the main subject in the image. If identity preservation to the input image is not important you can use higher values here to create more creative animation. If it is (eg for human faces), use a lower value like 0.2

      When increasing this value, you typically also want to make a longer animation with slightly higher animation strength levels.

      Activate this option to create a dolly zoom effect that generates a seamless loop. For short animations this can look a bit unnatural though.

      Activate this option to leverage the style_image for generating the animation. Note that the style image will be most active where the denoise value is the highest (foreground and/or background)!

      A style image to guide the animation (effect will be relative to the chosen animation strength values).
    tip: |-
      The image will apply a style effect (using ip-adapter) that gets added in the most heavily denoised regions.

      A good default for ip-adapter is around 0.75, with ranges between 0.5 for subtle guidance, and 1.0 for more heavy handed results.
