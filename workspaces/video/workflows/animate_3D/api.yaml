name: Animate an image with depth
description: Precise image animation using 3D-zoom.
thumbnail: app/animate_3D_opt.mp4
tip: This should be the default tool to use when a user requests to make a video out of an image with no other specific requirements. If the image has a clear or obvious foreground subject, use a lower foreground_denoise strength to avoid corrupting the subject. This tool works by separating the input image by approximated depth layers and animating them independently with a Ken Burns style parallax effect.

  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the background of the input image. This can usuaully be somewhat higher than the foreground motion strength unless the user requests otherwise or wants the background to remain fairly consistent.

  description: Motion strength in the foreground
  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the foreground of the input image. Typically, you want to keep this value in the low range (0.25 - 0.4) to avoid drifting too far away from the main subject in the image. If identity preservation to the input image is not important you can use higher values here to create more animation. If it is, use a lower value.

  tip: The output video will be 1 second long for every 8 frames generated. (The default of 32 frames will thus generate a 4s animation)

  tip: This will force the last frame to be identical to the first and make a seamless loop. Unless specifically requested, this should be kept at False (default).
