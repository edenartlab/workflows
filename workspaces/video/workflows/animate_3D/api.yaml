name: 3D-Animate
description: Animate a single image with 3D depth motion, while staying visually close to the input image. This tool will apply different amounts of animated motion on the background (a lot) vs foreground (subtle) to try to stay visually close to the foreground subject in the image.
tip: This should be the default tool to use when a user requests to make a video out of an image with no other specific requirements. If the image has a clear or obvious foreground subject, use a lower foreground_denoise strength to avoid corrupting the subject.

  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the background of the input image. This can usuaully be somewhat higher than the foreground motion strength unless the user requests otherwise or wants the background to remain fairly consistent.

  description: Motion strength in the foreground
  tip: Higher values cause more animation, but also stray further away from the foreground of the input image. Typically, you want to keep this value in the low range (0.25 - 0.4) to avoid drifting too far away from the main subject in the image. If identity preservation to the input image is not important you can use higher values here to create more animation. If it is, use a lower value.

  description: Number of video frames to generate.
  tip: The output video will be 1 second long for every 8 frames generated. (The default of 32 frames will thus generate a 4s animation)
