description: Creative image animation (using AnimateDiff)
thumbnail: app/img2vid_opt.mp4
tip: This will animate a single image and produce an animated video version that can drift away a bit from the source image but produces creative outputs, ideal for abstract visuals, not ideal for realistic scenes. Dont use this tool whenever you need to use multiple images to create a video.

  description: How much room to give the AI model to invent new details and create motion. 0.65 = default, increasing this value (to eg 0.8) also increases video motion. Lowering to eg 0.4 will only create very subtle animation but stay very close to the source image.

  description: Use a motion brush mask image to only create motion in certain areas (white = motion, black = no motion)
  tip: The motion_mask must be generated with another tool first. Create a mask where the to-be-animated regions are white and the rest is black.
