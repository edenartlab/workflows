name: FrameInterpolation
description: Mix multiple images into a video by interpolating between frames. Works with images, archives or video files, and can be used to slow down or speed up a movie.

tip: This workflow creates animations from a set of images or movie. First the input type is determined; whether images, archive, movie or url, the input is parsed and treated as an image batch that can be sorted by metadata or by visual similarity, and then n number of interpolation frames are added in between each provided frame.

  label: Interpolation Images
  description: Interpolation images are keyframes between which new interpolation frames will be created. Image sequence folders, archives and video are all treated as a batch of frames.
  tip: If multiple resolutions are present in an image batch, the width and height of the output will be set by the dimensions of the first image in the batch after sorting.

  label: Interpolation Frames
  description: interpolation frames is a multiplier of the original frame counter created between every provided frame of an image sequence or movie. A value of 2 will double the frames, effectively creating a half speed version. A value of 29 will stretch each frame to a full second per provided frame if the Framerate parameter is set to 30 FPS. A value of 1 will not create any interpolation frames; If Skip Frame Interval is set 1, this would effectively create a double speed video from a movie input.
  tip: The output video will be confromed to this framerate. This should stay at the default unless another FPS is specified by the user. Other common framerates are 60fps, 30fps(broadcast default), 24fps (cinema), or 12fps (anime). This parameter does not set the number of frames, only the rate at which the video conforms the total n_frames.

  tip: This will force the last frame to be identical to the first and make a seamless loop. Unless specifically requested, this should be kept at False (default).

  description: Make the animation a seamless loop by concatenating a forward and reversed version of the animation. This term is sometimes called bounce or pingpong; the video will play forwards and then reverse itself back to the beginning.
  tip: This will force the last frame to be identical to the first and make a seamless loop. Unless specifically requested, this should be kept at False (default).

  description: Choose a frame interpolation model method. RIFE models are fast and cheap, whereas FILM is much slower and therefore more expensive, while having an identifiable different (but not necessarily better or higher quality) result when the interpolation_frames parameter value is high (greater than 6).

  label: Retain Video FPS
  description: This toggle preserves the original FPS of an input video. 
  tip: This is useful for creating slow motion videos that play back at the original framerate, if that framerate is not the default of 30fps. For instance, European cinematic standards are 25fps, and if you'd like to keep your output video conformed to this framerate, this value could be true. This is an advanced parameter that should always be falsue unless otherwise specified.

  label: Image Count Cap
  description: Limit the maximum number of images processed from a video or image sequence. A 0 value has no limit
  tip: This parameter can be used to only grab n number of images from a sequence or video clip. If a user asks to only use the first 10 seconds of a video clip, this calculation could be done by assuming a frame rate of 30FPS and limiting the Image Count Cap to 300 frames. This is also useful when sorting, for example a batch of provided images capped to three and sorted by random will always pick 3 random images from a list.

  label: Image Skip Interval
  description: This parameter determines the number of images to skip from a sequence or video; setting the value to 1 would ignore every other frame.
  tip: This parameter is most useful for reducing the number of frames processed from a video or image batch. Setting this value to 1 and keeping interpolation_frames at 1 would produce a double speed video with no interpolation.
