description: Generate sound effects with Stable Audio.
tip: |-
  This tool uses the Stable Audio Open model, which is optimized for generating short audio samples, sound effects, and production elements. Ideal for loops and stems rather than full audio arrangements. Makes good drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient sounds, foley recordings, and other audio samples. The model was trained on data from Freesound and the Free Music Archive, respecting creator rights, and natively supports clip lengths of up to 47 seconds of audio.

    tip: |-
      StabilityAI recommends structuring prompts using Format, Genre, Sub-genre, Instruments, Moods, BPM and Styles, separating the structure with a | pipe character. An example prompt from their website looks like this: Genre: Trap | Styles: well arranged | Instruments: tap delay marimba arp, Shaker, Rim shot, 808 Kick, Syncopated Percussion, lush synthesizer pads, reverberating bongos, modular synth arp, granular synthesized | Moods: Ethereal, Transcendent, Atmospheric, Hypnotic | BPM: 130

      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!

    tip: |-
      the default of 50 produces well rounded results, with a change of character that may be satisfying around 100 steps, at the cost of a slower generation time. 200 steps is the extreme end beyond which any quality improvements seem negligable.
    default: 50

      the default of 5.0 might be considered thoroughly cooked, whereas the specified maximum is well done, and the minimum is rare.
