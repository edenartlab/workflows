name: Create sound effects
description: Generate sound effects with Stable Audio.
tip: |-
  Optimized for generating short audio samples, sound effects, and production elements. Ideal for loops and stems rather than full audio arrangements. Makes good drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient sounds, foley recordings, and other audio samples. The model was trained on data from Freesound and the Free Music Archive, respecting creator rights.

      Specifying tempo, key and style information can help guide the generation towards a more desirable result.

      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!

    tip: |-
      the default of 50 produces well rounded results, with a change of character that may be satisfying around 100 steps, at the cost of a slower generation time. 200 steps is the extreme end beyond which any quality improvements seem negligable.

    tip: |-
      the default of 5.0 might be considered thoroughly cooked, whereas the specified maximum is well done, and the minimum is rare.
