name: Stable Audio
description: Generate sound effects
tip: Optimized for generating short audio samples, sound effects, and production elements. Ideal for loops and stems rather than full audio arrangements. Makes good drum beats, instrument riffs, ambient sounds, foley recordings, and other audio samples. The model was trained on data from Freesound and the Free Music Archive, respecting creator rights.

  description: Length of diffusion steps
  tip: the default of 50 produces well rounded results, with a change of character that may be satisfying around 100 steps, at the cost of a slower generation time. 200 steps is the extreme end beyond which any quality improvements seem negligable.
