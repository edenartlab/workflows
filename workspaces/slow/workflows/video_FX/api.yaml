description: Apply AI effects to regions of a video
tip: |-
  This tool allows you to add creative AI effects to regions of a video. 
  You can use this to apply cool post-effects on parts of existing videos, eg adding animated textures to a flat background, replacing bright objects (the sun, lights, etc) with motion graphics, but cannot be used to replace objects in a video.
  It can be tricky to achieve good results in the first go, tweaking of the settings is often required!

    label: Region strength on objects/regions close to the camera
    description: Strength of the AI effect on regions in the video that are close to the camera (depth). (Negative values will instead cause far away stuff to be stylized)
    tip: |-
      This will create a the first (of three) mask that will determine where the AI stylization effect will occur in the source video.

  edge_strength:
    type: float
    label: Region strength on edges and textures
    description: Strength of the AI effect on regions in the video that have lots of edges and texture. Setting this to a negative value is typically nice since regions with less texture (eg flat colors) are good targets for effects.
    tip: |-
      Generates the second (of three) masks, typically negative values here are good since this will apply the AI effect to flat regioins of the input video, destroying less information and instead adding new animated AI texture regions.

    tip: |-
      Third masking region (positive will target bright regions, negative will target dark regions). After this, all three masks will get combined to produce the final animation target mask.

    label: Total AI effect strength
    description: Maximum strength of the AI effect on the combined target regions. 0.45-0.65 is a good range.
    tip: |-
      This is the denoising strength that will be applied to the masked regions of the video. Higher values will result in more stylized output. Lower values will stay closer to the original video.

  min_denoise:
    type: float
    label: Minimum AI effect strength
    description: This effect strength will be applied to the non-targetted regions in the video. Suggested to keep this at zero unless you want to experiment with crazy stuff!
    tip: |-
      Keeping this at zero will result in the unmasked regions of the video being unchanged, only the masked regions will be stylized with the style image.
      Increasing this value will apply the AI effect to the unmasked regions as well, often causing loss of input details and weirder artifacts. In some cases this can create a more homogeneous look, but it is not recommended for most use cases.

      Higher resolutions usually leads to better quality output videos. 
      1024 is a good default, 768 can be used to do a quick test, > 1024 is for best quality but very slow
    tip: |-
      You can sometimes increase the resolution to achieve a higher quality style transfer effect, however this comes at a big speed and cost tradeoff, so only use this when specifically requested!
