name: Extend an image (Outpaint)
description: Expand an image to a different aspect ratio by outpainting.
tip: |-
  This tool uses FLUX.1. 
  Keep in mind that a non-technical user may not have the vocabulary to describe what they want, and interpret their request with your best judgement as to whether or not the outpainting is what they are requesting, considering terms like outpaint, zoom out,expand, add to the side of this image,or other prompts for an image canvas to be larger as a suggestion to consider this tool when provided with such a request and an image to operate on.

      This is the number of creations to generate for the prompt. If you get a request for n_samples > 1, you are still using a *single* prompt for the whole set.

    description: Specify the pixels in each direction from the starting image, leaving its resolution unchanged.
    tip: |-
      This should only be active if a user wants to outpaint with a specified direction and pixel count. A zoomed out image could be made by adding an even pixel could like 128 to each of args left top right and bottom, but that number should really not be any higher than 256, 128 is a good default

  steps:
    type: integer
    label: Steps
    description: Number of diffusion steps
    tip: |-
      Increasing the steps increases the quality of the image with diminishing returns beyond 35, as well as the run time. 
      Only change this if you want to experiment with undercooking the image, or are using a specialized model.
