name: TextureFlow
description: Mix multiple images into a video, optionally add a driving motion or shape.
tip: |-
  This tool creates smooth, trippy, artistic, morphing animations from a set of style images (texture) and other optional inputs. Ideal creating for vj loops, animated logo's and abstract animations.
  One to six style images form the basic inputs of this tool, driving the textures, content and colors of the animation. 
  In general, the video length should be scaled proportionally with the number of style images, 3s of animation per style image is a good rule of thumb.
  When doing quick experimentation with settings you can set upscale:false to produce a faster but lower resolution test render. 
  Set upscale:true to generate a full HD final output video. Before using this tool, always print the settings you're about to use and ask the user to confirm before executing the tool!
  There is an optional control_input (set use_controlnet1 to true) and preprocessor1 type that can add specific shape/motion guidance to the generated video 
  like embedding the contours of a logo or word into the video or eg applying the lines or perceived depth of a projection surface when doing videomapping.
  In general, running TextureFlow without a control_input almost always produces visually appealing results, adding a control_input is a bit trickier and often requires playing around with settings a bit more.
  The wrong combination of control_input and style images may look bad (especially when the control strength is too high),
  but the right combo can look absolutely amazing and is one of Edens special endpoints that make our platform unique!

  Some example use cases for TextureFlow:
  - abstract, artistic image animation using style image(s)
  (this will completely deform the input image and lose lots of details but its great to generate beautiful, smooth, animated textures). Don't use this for narrative video.
  - mixing multiple style_images using various motion mapping modes to create slick, looping VJ content (abstract, artistic animations)
  - using a logo image as control_input + texture image(s) can create really cool logo animations.
  - using a simple motion input video or gif (with simple lines / edges / contours) is a great way to drive unique animations (and add new textures with style images)
  - TextureFlow can even produce animated QR codes by setting the QR code image as control_input and using the none controlnet mode.

    tip: |-  
      In most cases, the default Scribble_XDoG_Preprocessor at strength 0.45 is a great starting point.
      Depth will try to maintain the perceived depth of the input scene but ignore edges and details.
      Canny edge creates strong edges adhering to the smaller details and shapes in your image, whereas scribble will guide towards a rougher sketched shape of your starting image and often produces better quality video at the cost of less detailed correspondence with the control image. 
      Pose will try to extract the pose from a person and inject it into the video. And none refers to QRmonster which simply maintains luminance of the input (dark and bright regions)

    tip: |-
      The default value of 1.1 is good for most cases. 
      Lowering to eg 0.9 will result in very subtle texture motion, increasing to eg 1.25 will result in more motion.
