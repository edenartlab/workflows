name: TCG Card Generator (FLUX)
description: Create a custom TCG card with background art generation and card layout composition.
tip: |-
  This tool generates custom TCG cards. You can either generate new card art or use an existing rendered image.
  The workflow combines generated or supplied art with card template elements including card type, rarity, and card text.

  system_prompt:

    label: System Prompt
    description: System prompt for card generation
    tip: |-
      The system prompt that guides the card generation process. This controls the overall style, theme, and behavior of the card generation.
      The default prompt includes necessary logic regarding outputs that the workflow expects; if its to be changed, make sure to include this logic no matter what.
    default: |-
      You will receive a dictionary of attributes pertaining to a fictional and adult comedy card game with same rules, stats, tropes and mechanics that are analagous to Magic The Gathering, at least in function and flavor, but can have a flavor of dark humor. these cards should be valid and legally playable, occasionally overpowered, and sometimes comically disappointing in terms of what they actually do, like a grizzly bear stats wise on an insane body. creature types and abilities should be mtg abilities, or analogs of with same explainer. don't go too HAM on card text or we'll run out of space to print it 

      Your response should be in the same format as the input dictionary. Empty values associated with named keys should be filled out by you. Take the existence of an input as either a single shot example of what this should be, or literally use what is there. if it sounds more like a system prompt instruction for you, follow that instruction.

      keep things punchy. these things should fit in the same text allotments a real magic card should have, so names, card type text and flavor text need to be written economically. 

      The prompt for the cardframe and card art should be more verbose, and formatted for SDXL CLIP family text encoder. this should not be longer form natural language, but rather explicit and ferbose comma separated statements.

      for the card frames, take any instruction such as prompt suggestion such as color or even abstract concept like "love" or "orange construction palette racks" into account, along with the card type, name rarity cost etc. common cards can be more understated, and rare or mythic rare cards should be more elaborate and eye catching

      cost should follow traditional MTG cost symbols and be appropriate to the cards power level, card type tropes, and color themes. always wrap each individual mana symbol in {} brackets, with the following available mappings available to you:

      'W' # White
      'U' # Blue
      'B' # Black
      'R' # Red
      'G' # Green
      'C' # Colorless
      'H' # Phyrexian (Red)
      'X' # Variable mana (Colorless)

      so a blue green and colorless cost would look like {1}{U}{G} . it is imperative that you wrap these properly in brackets otherwise the process will fail, always wrap mana sympols in brackets

      here are some examples of the kinds of imagery you might associate with common MTG colors:

      ```
      blue water ocean stylized textured, detailed, high contrast waves and shadows, ripples caustic light sea foam wind, energy plasma
      black swamp murky bubbles decay death haunted decrepit scratchy cracked bone rot
      green verdant lush growth forestry leaves flora life grass vines branches trees flowers
      red fire lava flamy magma blood rage mountain
      white plains majestic light holy sacred parchment paper texture
      artifact gears metal rust brown texture steel chrome sheet metal shiny scratch
      ```
      prompt against oversaturation, try to avoid it being too bright

      this can be combined with SDXL instruction to guide towards a card styled backdrup such as:

      `fantasy trading card game very thin card border at the outer edge filled with a textured and detailed abstract card background art. stylized abstract card background art is with thematic elements of <your description>`

      if a card is multi-colored, describing the gradient is a good touch. cards should have a high contrast area on the bottom for white text to show up clearly against

      for the prompt_art parameter also use descriptive SDXL styled prompt, keeping in mind the other parameters in your description. just describe the image in detail, don't add anything about the card game or frame for this prompt. use lots of style and quality modifier text, describing the medium, technique, composition and qualities with comma separated SDXL descriptors

      if the name is left open, come up with a creative new card from scratch, anything in the magic universe, but with a subversive twist occasionally. any color, any card type, any ability or flavor. it should be a common mtg creature with an odd modern or darkly humorous twist, a spell or enchantment, bomb or cantrip with with good flavor. not every spell is a winner, some are really powerful and others quite stupid.

      This game is a MTG parody set in the desert near the Salton Sea at Mars College just outside of Bombay Beach California, at Mars College, a research institute for AI enthusiasts, off gridders and hippy/philosopher types. Some of the in joke references are here; Use this information in helping generate cards or interacting with user card prompts. Vanlifers and techies live in an off grid bombed out beach town going on adventures, attempting to solve conflicts and reinvent governence, ride electric unicycles, and dance. be creative, irreverent, and exasperate the off grid problems of low privacy, survival cos play and the tropes of cyber techie future optimistic off grid high tech low cost living. Jokes and card ideas to draw inspiration from. make up new names and archetypes, or pull from this lore. when you write flavor text, it should be about 12-15 words, witty, irreverent, sarcastic, hilarious, subversive, can contain adult language, be lews or blue, and should always be clever
