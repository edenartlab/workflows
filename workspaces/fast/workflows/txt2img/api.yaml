name: Create an image (SDXL)
description: |-
  Generate an image from text using the classic SDXL model and trained concepts (LoRAs).
tip: |-
  Only use this tool for image generation if you are specifically asked to use Stable Diffusion (SDXL) or to use a Lora with SDXL as its base model. 
  Otherwise you should always prefer one of the Flux models for image generation. 
  Although lower quality, SDXL can produce artistic results with more unusual characteristics.

      Use landscape aspect ratio for prompts that are wide or more landscape-oriented, and portrait for taller things. 
      When using portrait, do not exceed 1:1.5. Only do square if the user requests it.

    tip: |-
      Using a starting image helps guide your prompted creation towards the elements present in your initial input. 
      If an image is supplied with the prompt or controlnet is employed, this should be always be true.

    description: Initial image from which to start diffusion process
    tip: |-
      A starting image will set the base for the diffusion process to generate from, 
      and will guide the output towards the colors and general composition of the starting image. 
      This is useful for image-to-image tasks.

  denoise:
    type: float
    label: Generation strength
    description: Strength of the generation process on top of the starting image
    tip: |-
      Decreasing generation strength increases the influence of a starting image in image-to-image workflows. 
      The default of 1 is 100% AI creativity, ignoring all traces of the starting image, 
      whereas a medium blend of about 50% will maintain close adherance to the original input. 
      Denoise should always stay at 1 unless an init image is employed; 
      never use less than 1 unless youre specifically trying to do an img2img task. 
      In scenario in which an image2image task is requested, the init_image should be true, and a starting image should be supplied. Never set this parameter to true unless an init image is provided.

    description: Override the provided width and height parameters with the actual resolution of your starting image.
    tip: |-
      Its best practice to use resolutions included in the models training data. 
      Upscaling later can get you to a higher resolution and is almost always better than generating directly at a high resolution. 
      Keep in mind that stable diffusion will always scale dimensions to the nearest divisible by 8 resolution, 
      so if an oddly shaped image is supplied, the output will preserve aspect ratio as closely as possible, 
      but the dimensions will not match the input exactly.

    tip: |-
      Its best practice to use resolutions included in the models training data. 
      This option will fill or crop the input image to a legal SDXL resolution, 
      producing results that are less likely to contain the artifacts typical of an unsupported resolution.

    description: Apply Controlnet guidance to the image generation to guide the generated image towards the shape of the starting image.
    tip: |-
      Controlnet uses an assortment of image preprocessors to guide the output results towards the shape of a Starting Image. 
      This parameter should never be true if no starting image is supplied, and should always be true if an init image is supplied 
      and the users request suggests they want guidance towards the shape of the input image. 
      Keep in mind that a non-technical user may not have the vocabulary to describe what they want, 
      and interpret their request with your best judgement as to whether or not they want shape guidance. 
      Shape guidance is a user friendly term used in Eden tools to refer to the application of controlnet conditioning.

    tip: |-
      Use best judgement based on the supplied image and user request to select the correct controlnet preprocessor and model to suit their needs. 
      Canny detects thin binary edges and is useful for tasks requiring fast edge detection, such as architectural designs or simple object outlines, 
      but it may struggle with complex scenes or noise. Depth generates luminance-based depth maps and is ideal for creating realistic 3D-like compositions, 
      such as emphasizing depth in landscapes or isolating foreground objects. HED excels at producing smooth, intricate edge detection and is suitable for detailed illustrations, 
      artistic line work, or noise-sensitive scenes. OpenPose identifies human keypoints, making it a perfect choice for generating images with accurate human poses, such as action shots, dance scenes, or character positioning. 
      LineArt converts images into detailed line drawings and is best for black-and-white artwork, manga-style illustrations, or clear contrast outlines. 
      Scribble processes rough sketches into structured inputs, ideal for refining rough concepts or integrating hand-drawn elements into finished compositions with a sketch-like aesthetic.

      A good default is around 0.6, with ranges around 0.4 for more subtle guidance (more freedom for the AI model),

    tip: |-
      Ipadapter takes compositional concepts, subjects and aesthetic elements from a style image and applies it to the generated image. 
      It essentially interprets prompt conditioning from the use of an input image, and is often referred to vernacularly throughout Eden tools as a style image. 
      A non-technical user may not have the vocabulary to describe what they want, interpret their request with your best judgement as to whether or not they want style guidance. 
      Style guidance is a user friendly term used in Eden tools to refer to the application of ipAdapter conditioning.
