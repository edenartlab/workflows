description: Apply interpolation to add in-between frames to a video, creating a slow motion movie.
tip: |-
  This workflow creates a slow motion movie, by adding interpolation frames to the input video with RIFE or FILM models. 
  It is best used to slow down and smooth the resulting creations from other video tools, resulting in an output movie that is 2, 3 or 4 times slower then the original input video.

    label: Interpolation Factor
    description: A multiplier of the original frame count of the input video.
    tip: |-
      This is a multiplier for the total number of frames present in the input video.
      A value of 2 will result in an output video double the amount of frames for example. 
      The default should be 2 if this tool is requested with the maximum of 8 being a very extreme slow down that might be used as an effect.

    label: Output Video Framerate
    description: Output video framerate
    tip: |-
      This should stay at the default unless another FPS is specified by the user.
      Other common framerates are 60fps, 30fps (broadcast default), 24fps (cinema), or 12fps (anime). 
      This parameter does not set the number of frames, only the rate at which the video plays, so this will affect the perceived speed of the output video!

    description: Make the animation a seamless loop by concatenating a forward and reversed version of the animation. This term is sometimes called bounce or pingpong; the video will play forwards and then reverse itself back to the beginning.
    tip: |-
      This will loop the video, making a ping-pong forward to reverse seamless loop by appending the reversed output video to the end of the generated output. 
      This term is sometimes called bounce or pingpong in video editing vernacular; the video will play forwards and then reverse itself back to the beginning.

    label: Retain Video FPS
    description: This toggle preserves the original FPS of an input video.
    tip: |-
      This is useful for creating slow motion videos that play back at the original framerate, if that framerate differs from the default FPS value of 24. 
      For instance, European cinematic standards are 25fps, and if youd like to keep your output video conformed to this framerate, this value could be true. 
      This is an advanced parameter that should always be falsue unless otherwise specified.
    default: false

    label: Image Count Cap
    description: Limit the maximum number of images processed from a video or image sequence. A 0 value has no limit
    tip: |-
      This parameter can be used to only grab n number of images from a sequence or video clip. 
      If a user asks to only use the first 10 seconds of a video clip, this calculation could be done by assuming a frame rate of 30FPS and limiting the Image Count Cap to 300 frames. 
      This is also useful when sorting, for example a batch of provided images capped to three and sorted by random will always pick 3 random images from a list.
