description: Blend or Remix Image(s) (using FLUX-redux).
tip: |-
  Flux is a text to image model that excels at prompt coherence and text generation. The flux redux model uses clipvision to create a conditioning from an input image, creating image remix variations or a blend between multiple style images. 
  This tool should be the default for a high quality remix of an image, or a blend between two images with some degree of promptability.

      This is the number of tries to generate for the prompt. If you get a request for
      n_samples > 1, you are still using a *single* prompt for the whole set.

    description: Crossfade between style image influence to blend two images together.
    tip: |-
      This parameter crossfades conditioning influence between image A and image B. 
      It is very sensitive, and it is recommended to leave it between .4 and .6 if you want to see influence from both images. 
      If an optional image B is not provided, this parameter has no effect.

    tip: |-
      Flux loves very detailed and descriptive prompts so try to be elaborate. 
      A prompt is not optional for remixing or blending images, but if you do want to influence a prompted creation with your style image, be sure to turn down the style_strength parameter to a very low amount for your prompt influence to come through

    description: Strength of the prompt image influence on the creation result.
    tip: |-
      This parameter is super sensative. 
      If you want any influence on the creation result from your text prompt, the recommended values are between .8-.95. 
      Because this parameter effects conditioning average between the text and the image, the prompt length and input size and content have a variable effect, so its good try a few values with a locked seed to dial this in. 
      This parameter has no effect if no prompt is provided.

    description: Strength of the prompt and image conditiong influence on the creation result.
    tip: |-
      This parameter controls the influence of propmt conditioning guidance on image generation. 
      For stylized images a lower value of 2.0-2.5 may be desirable, and for realistic images closer to 3.0 is a good value, with an extreme minimum around 1.5. 
      Higher values will more closely follow the input text and produce clean images but also have less diversity.

    tip: |-
      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. 
      Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!
