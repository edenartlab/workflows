name: Temple Abyss Epic Lore Master Card Generator
description: Create a custom Temple Abyss card with background art generation, clan-specific elements, and epic lore master styling.
tip: |-
  This tool generates custom Temple Abyss cards with epic lore master styling.
  You can either generate new card art or use existing rendered images.
  The workflow combines generated or supplied art with clan-specific elements, including clan overlays, icons, and rarity badges.
  Card styling is enhanced with epic lore master elements and text effects, generating a 1024x1024 image and then outpainting it for full card art at 1248x2000 resolution.

    tip: |-
      Upload a reference image that can be used in multiple ways:
      1. As a ControlNet reference for art generation
      2. As pre-rendered art for the card
      3. As a base image for outpainting
      The workflow will automatically determine the best use based on other settings.

    description: |-
      What type of shape guidance to apply. Different types have subtly different effects on the output.
    tip: |-
      Use best judgement based on the supplied image and user request to select the correct controlnet preprocessor and model to suit their needs. Canny detects thin binary edges and is useful for tasks requiring fast edge detection, such as architectural designs or simple object outlines, but it may struggle with complex scenes or noise. Depth generates luminance-based depth maps and is ideal for creating realistic 3D-like compositions, such as emphasizing depth in landscapes or isolating foreground objects. HED excels at producing smooth, intricate edge detection and is suitable for detailed illustrations, artistic line work, or noise-sensitive scenes. OpenPose identifies human keypoints, making it a perfect choice for generating images with accurate human poses, such as action shots, dance scenes, or character positioning, but will fail if a person isn't detected, so only use this one if you have reason to believe an image containing a person was provided as init. LineArt converts images into detailed line drawings and is best for black-and-white artwork, manga-style illustrations, or clear contrast outlines. Scribble processes rough sketches into structured inputs, ideal for refining rough concepts or integrating hand-drawn elements into finished compositions with a sketch-like aesthetic.
    default: depth
    choices: [none, canny, depth, scribble, pose, threshold, lineart]
