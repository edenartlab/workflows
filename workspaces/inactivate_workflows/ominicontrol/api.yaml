name: Instant LoRA
description: Take a single example subject image and a prompt to reimagine that subject into a new context.
tip: |-
  This is a form of instant, single image lora. This means you can provide one example of a subject (perfect for toys, characters, objects and logos) and then copy-paste that thing into a new context. A common example is placing a logo on a tshirt or coffee mug, or prompting a character or toy into a new environment.
  It uses the FLUX model behind the scenes and often requires a few tries with different seeds to get a good result. This tool only produces square 1024x1024 images, so for other aspect ratios you need to chain this with an outpainting tool call. This is kinda of like an instant (no-training) lora tool from a single image.

    tip: |-
      Flux loves very detailed and descriptive prompts so try to be elaborate. Flux is also great at drawing text in images when requested. Flux uses a T5 text encoder in addition to CLIP, which allows for more conversational human-like natural language prompting. Create great T5 text encoder prompts for Flux-dev by specifying the subject, style, composition, lighting, color palette, mood/atmosphere, technical details, and additional elements to guide the generation of detailed and cohesive visual descriptions.

      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!

      This is the number of outputs generated for this prompt. If you get a request for n_samples > 1, you are still using a *single* prompt for the whole set.
