name: Replace part of an image (Inpaint)
description: Select and replace anything in an image (FLUX)
tip: |-
  This workflow edits a specific region in the given image by first applying the masking prompt to highlight a specific region of the image, and then applying the inpainting prompt to fill (re-draw) in the highlighted region. 
  Use this tool when a user requests changes to a specific object or region in an image.

    description: Description (just one or a few words) of what object / region you want to replace / inpaint.
    tip: |-
      This prompt will be used to highlight the object/region to inpaint, creating a mask.
      Try to make this prompt as short, clean and simple as possible. use single words instead of full sentences.
      Some examples of good masking prompts are face, building, hair, headwear, hat, ...

    tip: |-
      Describe what you want to replace the masked region with. Focus on describing just the new content,
      not the entire scene since the surrounding areas will remain unchanged.

    description: Use background detection to create an inpainting mask
    tip: |-
      rembg generates a very precise gradient mask that can be used for inpainting background / foreground regions in an image.
      When activating this, you can typically reduce mask_expand and mask_blur to zero.
      Make sure to leave masking_prompt empty when activating this!

    description: How much the surrounding scene influences the inpainting. Recommended values 0.7-0.9
    tip: |-
      This controls how much the inpainting looks at the surrounding (fixed) content in the image.
      Lower values can produce more creative outputs that have better prompt adherence but they often tend to look misplaced and out of context with the rest of the scene.

    description: Make the inpainting region slightly larger to make the results more realistic
    tip: |-
      The default is typically fine. If the masking prompt is targetting a small object, but the inpainting object is something larger, you may want to increase this value to give the inpainting model enough space to draw the new thing. 
      If the inpainting region needs to be very precise you can very rarely decrease this value to eg 24.

  mask_blur:

    label: Blur the inpainting mask at the edges
    description: Making the inpainting region blurry at the edges can make the results slightly better
    tip: The default is typically fine. If the mask has lots of fine edges, you can consider tuning this down to avoid erasing the details in the mask.
