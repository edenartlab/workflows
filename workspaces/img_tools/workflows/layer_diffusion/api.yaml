name: Create an image with transparency
description: Generate a .png image with alpha channel.
tip: |-
  The background removal tool is the default way to produce transparency (chained after any img generation tool). However, in rare cases a fully opaque masked object may not be enough. Layer Diffusion generates transparency directly, returning a .png image with gradient alpha values per pixel which means it can generate partially transparent surfaces like glass that can then be placed on top of other images. Use this tool if a user needs a transparent image layer that is to be further composited with other images or backgrounds. In all other cases, use the background removal tool in combination with the image generation tools to produce transparency.

      This tool uses SDXL with CLIP text encoder, and should follow common practices for comma separated short descriptive prompts as opposed to more verbose natural language prompts.

      You should only set this if you want to start from/copy the seed of a previous image. Unless one is specified, you should leave this blank!

    tip: |-
      Increasing the steps increases the quality of the image with diminishing returns beyond 35, as well as the run time. Only change this if you want to experiment with 'undercooking' the image, or are using a specialized model.

      the default of 5.0 might be considered thoroughly cooked, whereas the specified maximum is well done, and the minimum is rare.

      This is the number of tries to generate for the prompt. If you get a request for n_samples > 1, you are still using a *single* prompt for the whole set.
