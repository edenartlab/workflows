name: Create an image (SDXL)
description: Generate an image from text using our classic SDXL model and trained concepts.
thumbnail: app/txt2img.png
tip: This is the most basic and common function which generates an image from text a prompt, with ControlNet guidance to maintain the contours or shape outlines of the input image while generating a new style or aesthetic on top of it, LoRA models to apply a pretrained fine tuned concept, and ipAdapter functionality to transfer the style from a Style Image to the output result.

  description: Describe an image
  tip: Prompts are specific, detailed, concise, and visually descriptive, avoiding unnecessary verbosity and abstract, generic terms. They usually have ● Primary subject (i.e., person, character, animal, object, ...), e.g "Renaissance noblewoman", "alien starship". Should appear early in prompt. ● Action of the subject, e.g. "holding an ancient book", "orbiting a distant planet", if there is no main subject, a good context description will do here (what is going on in the scene?). They sometimes have several stylistic modifiers near the end of the prompt, such as ● Background, environment or context surrounding the subject, e.g. "in a dimly lit Gothic castle", "in a futuristic 22nd century space station". ● Secondary items that enhance the subject or story. e.g. "wearing an intricate lace collar", "standing next to a large, ancient tree". ● Color schemes, e.g. "shades of deep red and gold", "monochrome palette with stark contrasts", "monochrome", ... ● Style or method of rendering, e.g. "reminiscent of Vermeer's lighting techniques", "film noir", "cubism", ... ● Mood or atmospheric quality e.g. "atmosphere of mystery", "serene mood". ● Lighting conditions e.g. "bathed in soft, natural window light", "dramatic shadows under a spotlight". ● Perspective or or viewpoint, e.g. "bird's eye view", "from a low angle", "fisheye", .. ● Textures or materials, e.g. "textures of rich velvet and rough stone". ● Time Period, e.g. "Victorian Era", "futuristic 22nd century". ● Cultural elements, e.g. "inspired by Norse mythology", "traditional Japanese setting". ● Artistic medium, e.g. "watercolor painting", "crisp digital Unreal Engine rendering", "8K UHD professional photo", "cartoon drawing", ... They often end with trigger words that improve images in a general way, e.g. "High Resolution", "HD", "sharp details", "masterpiece", "stunning composition", ... If the prompt contains a request to render text, enclose the text in quotes, e.g. A Sign with the text “Peace”. IMPORTANT, If the user gives you a short, general, or visually vague prompt, you should augment their prompt by imagining richer details, following the tips above. If a user gives a long, detailed, or well-thought out composition, or requests to have their prompt strictly adhered to without revisions or embellishment, you should adhere to or repeat their exact prompt. The goal is to be authentic to the user's request, but to help them get better results when they are new, unsure, or lazy.

  label: Generation strength
  description: Strength of the generation process on top of the starting image
  tip: Decreasing generation strength increases the influence of a starting image in image-to-image workflows. The default of 1 is 100% AI creativity, ignoring all traces of the starting image, whereas a medium blend of about 50% will maintain close adherance to the original input. Denoise should always stay at 1 unless an init image is employed; never use less than 1 unless you're specifically trying to do an img2img task.

  tip:  depth will recreate an approximate depth of your input scene, and is best for 3 dimensional compositions. Canny edge creates strong edge detection adherance to the shape of your image, with cannyv2 as an updated model that's sharper but with less detail. The scribble model will create guidance towards a rougher sketched shape of your starting image. pose follows an open pose skeleton of a character's body position. threshold creates a hard black and white matte from the input image, and lineart provides a crisp hard edge guidance from the input.

Only do square if the user requests it. Use your best judgment.
