name: ID Generator
description: Create a Student ID.
tip: |-
  This is a tool for students of Mars College to create a Student ID card. 
  This tool does not generate the portrait image, it requires a user supplied image to populate a generative form filled ID card template. 
  If a user wants an image of a character or to use a LoRA or ipadapter for their portrait image, create that first with another tool and use that output as the portrait image input required by this tool.

      Describe the style and scenery of the background of your ID
    tip: |-
      Flux loves very detailed and descriptive human readable natural language T5 text encoder prompts so try to be elaborate. The ID benefits from a description including vibrant colors at the top and bottom of the composition. An example of an effective prompt looks like the default for this parameter.
