name: Image to Video
description: Create an animated version of the input image. Higher width x height may improve the quality of the video, but take much longer to render. 
tip: This will animate a single image and produce an animated video version that can drift away a bit from the source image but produces creative outputs, ideal for abstract visuals, not ideal for realistic scenes. Dont use this tool whenever you need to use multiple images to create a video.

  label: Control Strength
  description: How strong the video should adhere to the input image. 0.6 = default, increasing this value (to eg 0.8) also reduces video motion, recommended to leave at default. Lowering to eg 0.4 can improve output video quality at the cost of likeness to the input image.
